                        field and are hands-on in design, manufacturing, marketing and operations. Each of their dealers
                        has over 10-15 years' experience in the field. Saviesa has its own facilities and manufacturing,

                        Hence you can be sure Saviesa can deliver on its commitments. The designs of Saviesa are new and
                        contemporary. Their products use the best of international techniques and materials as

                        Founders and staff. We approach your needs and aspirations differently from other companies who
                        entered the field earlier. Indeed, our whole design and operating principles are built around

                      <p> Saviesa is a company founded by the people who pioneered modular kitchens in India. This is
                        the second company they have started. The founders have combined experience of 80 years in this
                        field and are hands-on in design, manufacturing, marketing and operations. Each of their dealers
                        has over 10-15 years' experience in the field. Saviesa has its own facilities and manufacturing,
                        which most of the older players in this field and even the ecommerce companies do not have.
                        Hence you can be sure Saviesa can deliver on its commitments. The designs of Saviesa are new and
                        contemporary. Their products use the best of international techniques and materials as
                        incorporated by the Founders. The roots of Saviesa are in the values and customer focus of its
                        Founders and staff. We approach your needs and aspirations differently from other companies who
                        entered the field earlier. Indeed, our whole design and operating principles are built around
                        you and your aspirations. We will be happy to email you a leaflet on the values of Saviesa
